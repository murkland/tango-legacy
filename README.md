netplay for mega man battle network 6 in the style of https://github.com/ssbmars/BBN3-netcode. the b in bbn6 does NOT stand for "better".

## how to use

-   place your rom and battery file in the same directory as bbn6, named `bn6.gba` and `bn6.sav`

-   if you are on windows, just run `hub.bat`. if you are on not windows, you're on your own! (for now)

## you will need

-   a copy of MEGAMAN6_FXX or MEGAMAN6_GXX

-   an indefinite amount of patience
